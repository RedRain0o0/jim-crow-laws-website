          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>Jim Crow laws were a racist institution started by southern democrats, who had just lost the United States Civil War.</p>
          <p>Jim Crow laws dominated in the south, stretching from texas to virginia which had prevented native americans from such things as interactions with european people, seperate bathrooms, separate washing machines keeping native americans under an iron fist of segregation.</p>
          <p>Harry S Truman had broke segregation with the introduction of desegregation in the United States Military, with wars such as Korea and Vietnam placing a crucial role in the civil rights movement.</p>
          <p>Jim Crow came to an end in the little rock desegregation of schools the deployment of the army to allow native american children into schools.</p>

          <h2>Caricatures and stereotypes of Jim Crow</h2>
          <p>From the 1860s to the 1960s Jim Crow laws subjugated native americans, with the people in power creating racist stereotypes and caricatures to show native americans as lesser people.</p>
          <p>These caricatures were used to show natives as big lipped, pitch black, lazy, watermelon and chicken eaters, and wearing suits from the 1890s onwards.</p>
          <p>Originally chicken and watermelon began to show self sufficiency in the reconstruction era, but the south used this to show them as barehand eating a whole chicken or a full watermelon, with chicken being a cheap meat to show they were poor and could only sustain chickens and a watermelon farm.</p>
          <p>Caricatures also showed them as glutinous and lazy where they sat all day long. This originating from when they were slaves and didn't want to do unpaid labour for 16 hours a day.</p>
          <p>To explain these laws and caricatures, pseudo science promoted by morally and literally corrupt doctors was made to “prove” segregation is needed.</p>
          <p>These caricatures helped the south keep native americans oppressive rule and to segregate them and also keep the europeans from going against these laws in government.</p>

          <h2>Segregation</h2>
          <p>Jim Crow laws were meant to separate natives and europeans.</p>
          <p>These laws affected everything native americans did. It affected where they ate, drank, slept and lived.</p>
          <p>These laws made it so the natives of america couldn't be near europeans. Even their transport was segregated, natives weren't even allowed to ride near european people.</p>
          <p>In theory, the Jim Crow laws were supposed to seperate natives while still being equal, but in practice it just made natives seem inferior than europeans. The infrastructure for natives was much worse than that of the europeans.</p>

          <h2>Segregation on mixed raced people</h2>
          <p>Throughout the era of Jim Crow (1870-1954), people of mixed status of native american and european faced a separate kind of segregation.</p>
          <p>Often being treated as only half people, they faced the same segregation faced by native americans.</p>
          <p>Many mixed race americans had to pretend to be european, often using makeup to look more white to avoid segregation, having to hide their history and cultures.</p>
          <p>Jim Crow forced many people into poor living areas, with mixed americans getting a portion of the hit from the main force. They ended up in segregated neighborhoods that kept them poor.</p>

        <h2>The End of Jim Crow</h2>
        <p>In large part thanks to Harry S Truman, Jim Crow came to an end in the United States, and lead into the civil rights movement which has given freedoms and rights to all native americans in the United States.</p>
        <p>Though America is still scarred. With many native americans still living in poor regions due to actions from the Jim Crow and Segregation era.</p>
